# i.e., (highest average value/ overall average purchase - lowest average value/ 	overall average purchase)

#  20.	Write a function that takes variable name as input & gives out the frequency of occurrence table of the distinct values of the variable


#  21.	Write a function that takes variable name & creates dummy variables:
#  For example, if we give age as input to the function, then the function creates 7 	distinct 	columns named Age_0-17, Age_55+ so on.,
#  For each of the 7 columns, it gives a value of 1 to the row if the value belongs to the 	column - i.e., Age_0-17 will be 1 only if Age = "0-17" else it is a 0.
